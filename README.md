Password Generator Homework

With the html and css provided, our goal here is to create a password generator using lowercase,uppercase,numbers or 
special characters as the user decides. 
What is expected includes:
-merging of arrays 
-merging based on input of user using confirms
-using math.random to select characters within the merged arrays
-create a for loop to spit out specified amount of characters based on merged arrays








//personal notes on subject
//This. Is. Hard. My main grievance is selecting the arrays based on input. Maybe I'm looking at it at the wrong
angle but it has proven quite the conundrum/issue/pain in the ass. I get the rest of it, easy, but this part really 
leaves me stumped.

# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Your Task 

This week’s homework requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by 
modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It 
will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation]
(https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
